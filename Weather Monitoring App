This project is based on Application of IOT.

I have built a weather monitoring app using MIT App Inventor.

Project Requirements:
IOT Simulator Sensor
IBM Cloud account
MIT App Inventor

Description:
The IOT simulator generates 3 properties viz. Temprature, Humidity and object Temprature.
These values get updated every few seconds on ibm iot platform.
I used Node red to retrive these values from iot platform in json format(eg. {"temperature":24,"humidity":74,"objectTemp":21} )
I made an app in MIT App Inventor and displayed these values in the app.
Whenever the value of any of the three parameter gets changed in the simulator correspondingly my values in the app gets updated.
